# Summary

Atmospheric correction is a critical preprocessing step in aquatic remote sensing, required to retrieve accurate water-leaving reflectance from satellite imagery. The ACOLITE (Atmospheric Correction for OLI 'lite') software [@vanhellemont2019; @vanhellemont2021] has become a widely-used tool for atmospheric correction of aquatic imagery, particularly for its dark spectrum fitting (DSF) algorithm. However, ACOLITE operates on individual downloaded scenes, limiting its scalability for large-scale or time-series analyses.

Google Earth Engine (GEE) [@gorelick2017] is a cloud-based platform that provides access to petabytes of satellite imagery and enables planetary-scale geospatial analysis. While GEE offers built-in atmospheric correction products for Sentinel-2 (Level-2A), these are optimized for terrestrial applications and often underperform in coastal and inland water environments where adjacency effects and complex atmospheric conditions are prevalent.

`GEE ACOLITE` bridges this gap by implementing ACOLITE's dark spectrum fitting atmospheric correction algorithm directly within the Google Earth Engine framework, enabling efficient, scalable atmospheric correction for aquatic applications.

# Statement of need

Researchers studying coastal and inland waters require accurate atmospheric correction to derive water quality parameters. Current workflows involve manually downloading scenes, processing individually with ACOLITE, managing large intermediate files, and combining results—an approach that is time-consuming and challenging to scale. While GEE provides Level-2A products via Sen2Cor [@louis2016], these are optimized for land applications and may not adequately account for adjacency effects, sun glint, and other factors critical for aquatic remote sensing [@warren2019].

`GEE ACOLITE` addresses these limitations by:

- **Implementing DSF correction in GEE**: Enabling ACOLITE's proven dark spectrum fitting algorithm within GEE's cloud infrastructure 
- **Eliminating data download requirements**: Processing occurs entirely within GEE, accessing imagery directly from the archive
- **Enabling scalable analysis**: Users can process entire image collections across large spatial and temporal extents
- **Providing water quality products**: Direct computation of SPM, turbidity, chlorophyll-a, and bathymetric indices
- **Supporting batch processing**: Efficient processing of multiple images with consistent settings

The package is designed for aquatic remote sensing researchers, environmental monitoring agencies, and coastal zone managers who require accurate atmospheric correction for water quality assessment and monitoring.

# Implementation

`GEE ACOLITE` is implemented in Python and interfaces with both the Earth Engine Python API [@earthengine] and the ACOLITE software package. The core atmospheric correction workflow includes:

1. **Dark spectrum extraction**: Three methods (darkest pixel, percentile, and intercept) for identifying dark water pixels
2. **Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) estimation**: Using lookup tables (LUTs) generated by ACOLITE
3. **Atmospheric correction**: Retrieving water-leaving reflectance using radiative transfer calculations
4. **Residual correction**: Optional sun glint corrections
5. **Water quality products**: Computation of derived products (SPM, chlorophyll, turbidity, bathymetry)

The package maintains compatibility with ACOLITE's configuration system while adapting the algorithms for GEE's distributed computing environment. Processing can be configured through Python dictionaries or ACOLITE-compatible settings files.

# Features

Key features of `GEE ACOLITE` include:

- **Multiple dark spectrum methods**: Darkest pixel, percentile-based, and linear regression intercept approaches
- **Flexible model selection**: Three criteria for optimal atmospheric model selection
- **Water quality parameters**: Built-in algorithms for SPM [@nechad2010], turbidity, chlorophyll-a [@oreilly1998; @oreilly2000], and bathymetry
- **Cloud masking**: Integration with Sentinel-2 Cloud Probability
- **Batch processing**: Efficient processing of image collections

# Example usage

```python
import ee
import acolite as ac
from gee_acolite import ACOLITE

ee.Initialize()

# Define area and time range
roi = ee.Geometry.Point([-76.7, 38.2])
images = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_HARMONIZED') \
    .filterBounds(roi) \
    .filterDate('2023-06-01', '2023-06-30')

# Configure processing
settings = {
    'aerosol_correction': 'dark_spectrum',
    'dsf_aot_estimate': 'fixed',
    'dsf_model_selection': 'min_drmsd',
    'l2w_parameters': ['spm_nechad2016', 'chl_oc2']
}

# Apply correction
processor = ACOLITE(ac, settings)
corrected_images, corrected_settings = processor.correct(images)
```

# Validation and Performance

The package has been validated against standalone ACOLITE processing for Sentinel-2 imagery. \autoref{fig:spectral_comparison} compares mean remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) spectra from eight scenes over Ria Formosa using three atmospheric correction approaches: (1) GEE's Sen2Cor L2A, (2) standalone ACOLITE (Local ACOLITE-Fixed), and (3) GEE ACOLITE.

The results demonstrate similar spectral responses across all tested scenes, with GEE ACOLITE retrievals closely matching the standalone ACOLITE processing. Both ACOLITE implementations show consistent retrieval of water-leaving reflectance across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, with typical values ranging from 0.005 to 0.020 sr$^{-1}$. The agreement between GEE ACOLITE and local ACOLITE processing validates the correct implementation of the dark spectrum fitting algorithm within the Google Earth Engine framework. Minor differences between Sen2Cor and ACOLITE-based retrievals are expected due to fundamental differences in atmospheric correction approaches, with ACOLITE's dark spectrum fitting method being specifically optimized for aquatic applications.

Beyond spectral validation, \autoref{fig:sdb} demonstrates the application of GEE ACOLITE-corrected imagery for satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) using Stumpf's ratio method [@stumpf2003]. The results show that water quality products derived from GEE ACOLITE are suitable for subsequent environmental applications.
